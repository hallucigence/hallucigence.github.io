# Hallucigence
## Overview
Hallucigence (a blend of the word *hallucinate* and *intelligence*) is an ambitious project aimed to create an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) through the attempt of creating a neural network that replicates the relevant mechanisms of the biological brain.
So far, the neural network does a good job at simulating many dynamics (that are relevant to achieving AGI) found in biological brains, such as...
* Spatiotemporality, allowing the neural network to learn & comprehend data that unfolds over time. This allows for reasoning over time as well, which is a much better approach to reasoning compared to LLM-based reasoning models.
* Synaptic plasticity, giving the neural network the ability to learn in real-time; no training stage and later on inference stage is involved, as both happen at the same time. The plasticity can be driven by reward signal(s), allowing for the neural network to learn & re-wire.
